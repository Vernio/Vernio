			<h2 class="about-title">About me</h2>
			<p class="about-text">In his youth, Paweł discovered how visual art can change the way ideas are shared; how one picture can stand for thousands of words – and not merely one picture, but how one icon or font can help find the right answer. That was fascinating to him, and inspired him to study in the Graphic department at the Fine Arts Academy of Warsaw and work as a graphic designer. 

			Paweł has been so impressed by how new technology reshapes communication that he has decided to devote his work to enhancing digital experiences through graphical representations. Paweł is a sociable person who loves spending time with his family, getting to know new cultures, enjoying nature – especially with his dog – or sailing with friends, and sometimes simply being ‘off the grid’.</p>
